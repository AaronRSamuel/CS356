What is sent: (Data/message, destination address, transport protocall)

UDP: identifies the HOST that the message is intented for.
Port number is 16 bits (aleast above 1K)
Web servers usually run on port 80
Reserved ports are usually for standards such as email standarnds and web hosting
Transport prodocall: What standerds the data used, so that the reciver can use the same protocalls to unpack the data
Loop back is a software service. that acts inplace of the network card that loops the info back into another application.
IP: unique for each Host interface (Wifi or Eithernet)
IP for loopback: 127.0.0.1

Python Notes:
serverSocket.bind(ServerIP, serverPORT) sets the port to listen to, and send from
serverSocket.recvfrom(Upperbound of size of data) takes the info that is recived and sets the variables to those values
data.encode() encodes the data to be a sequence of bytes.
	YOU NEED TO CONVERT THE DATA TO BYTES BEFORE SENDING
socket.socketTimeout(time in nanoseconds): sets the time where the CPU is blocked

Coommand Lines for HW!:
server: 127.0.0.1 12000
Client: 127.0.0.1 12000 10
